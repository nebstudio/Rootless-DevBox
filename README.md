## What is Rootless-DevBox?

Rootless-DevBox is a project that enables users to install and use [Devbox](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox) in environments where they don't have root access, such as shared hosting, university systems, or corporate environments with restricted permissions. It leverages [nix-user-chroot](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-user-chroot) to create a containerized environment where Nix and Devbox can run without requiring elevated privileges.

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **No Root Required**: Install and use Devbox without sudo or root privileges
- üîÑ **Isolated Environment**: Run packages in a contained environment without affecting the system
- üöÄ **Easy Setup**: One script to set up everything automatically
- üíª **Cross-Platform**: Works on various Linux distributions and architectures
- üîí **Safe**: Only modifies your user environment, not system files

## Quick Start

Simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebstudio/Rootless-DevBox/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download and run manually:

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -o rootless-devbox-installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebstudio/Rootless-DevBox/main/install.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x rootless-devbox-installer.sh

# Run the installer
./rootless-devbox-installer.sh
```

## How it Works

Rootless-DevBox sets up your environment in 3 main steps:

1. **Install nix-user-chroot**: Downloads and configures a tool that creates a userspace chroot environment
2. **Create nix environment**: Sets up a containerized Nix environment in your user directory
3. **Install Devbox**: Installs Devbox within this environment so you can use it without root

After installation, you'll access your development environment using the `nix-chroot` command, which activates the isolated environment where Devbox is available.

## Usage

### Entering the Nix Environment

After installation, enter the Nix environment by running:

```bash
nix-chroot
```

You'll see your prompt change to indicate you're in the nix-chroot environment:

```
(nix-chroot) user@hostname:~$
```

### Using Devbox

Once inside the nix-chroot environment, you can use Devbox normally:

```bash
# Show help
devbox help

# Initialize a new project
devbox init

# Add packages
devbox add nodejs python

# Start a shell with your development environment
devbox shell
```

### Exiting the Environment

To exit the nix-chroot environment:

```bash
exit
```

## Requirements

- Linux-based operating system
- Bash shell
- Internet connection
- No root access needed!

## Supported Architectures

- x86_64
- aarch64/arm64
- armv7
- i686/i386

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: I get "command not found" when trying to use nix-chroot.**  
A: Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Try running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting your terminal.

**Q: Installation fails when downloading nix-user-chroot.**  
A: Check your internet connection. If the issue persists, try manually downloading the appropriate binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-user-chroot/releases).

**Q: I can't install packages in the nix environment.**  
A: Some systems have quotas or disk space limitations. Check your available space with `df -h ~`.
